<p>Sticking Place is yet another "junk drawer" C# library of useful extensions and helpers.</p>

<h2>SqlHelpers</h2>

<p>Helpers for ADO.NET/SQL</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SqlExceptionHelper</strong>: Create SqlException objects with whatever message and error number you'd like. See SqlExceptionHelperTests for more information. This should only be used for testing, I can't think of a good reason to use it otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>WebHelpers</h2>

<p>Helpers for ASP.NET</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HttpExtensions::SetAuthCookie</strong>: On the surface, it seems like Forms Auth only lets you put a string (username) into a cookie. You can put arbitrary objects in there, but you have to jump through some extra hoops to do it. SetAuthCookie jumps through the hoops.</li>
<li><strong>HttpExtensions::GetAuthCookie</strong>: Get the arbitrary object back out of the Forms Auth cookie without all the hoop jumping.</li>
<li><strong>ModelStateDictionaryExtensions::GetAllErrors</strong>: A convenience extension to walk through the whole MVC ModelState errors tree. Good for unit testing sometimes too.</li>
</ul>

<h2>StringHelpers</h2>

<p>Helpers for string manipulation</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>StringExtensions::ToMD5</strong>: Encoded a string to an MD5 string. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/md5-password-scrambler-no-longer-safe/12317">You should probably not be using MD5 for anything involving important</a>, but for legacy/conversion reasons you may need to have this handy.</li>
</ul>
